    """
    Class for simulating and processing Monte Carlo experiments for Penney's Game.

    Attributes:
        decks_prosessed (int): The total number of decks that have been processed.
        results_by_cards (np.ndarray): A 3D array (shape: 8x8x2) storing cumulative outcomes using
            the cards-based scoring method. For each pair of player choices, the two values represent
            Player 2's wins and ties.
        results_by_tricks (np.ndarray): A 3D array (shape: 8x8x2) storing cumulative outcomes using
            the tricks-based scoring method. For each pair of player choices, the two values represent
            Player 2's wins and ties.

    Methods:
        play_penney(pick1, pick2, deck, standings):
            Simulates a single round of Penney's Game with a given deck and updates the standings.
        simulations():
            Runs simulations across all unique combinations of player choices using the stored decks.
        get_percents(tricks=True):
            Calculates and returns the win and tie percentages for the specified scoring method.
        get_decks():
            Returns the total number of decks that have been processed.
        load_past_data():
            Loads previously saved simulation data from storage, updating internal state accordingly.
        save_simulations():
            Saves the current simulation data (results and number of processed decks) to storage files.
